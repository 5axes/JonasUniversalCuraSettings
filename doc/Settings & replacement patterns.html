Higher values produce faster prints in lower resolution, lower values produce slower prints in higher resolution.</td></tr><tr><td>{layer_height_0}</td><td>Initial Layer Height</td><td>The height of the initial layer in mm. A thicker initial layer makes adhesion to the build plate easier.</td></tr><tr><td>{line_width}</td><td>Line Width</td><td>Width of a single line. Generally, the width of each line should correspond to the width of the nozzle. However, slightly reducing this value could produce better prints.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_line_width}</td><td>Wall Line Width</td><td>Width of a single wall line.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_line_width_0}</td><td>Outer Wall Line Width</td><td>Width of the outermost wall line. By lowering this value, higher levels of detail can be printed.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_line_width_x}</td><td>Inner Wall(s) Line Width</td><td>Width of a single wall line for all wall lines except the outermost one.</td></tr><tr><td>{skin_line_width}</td><td>Top/Bottom Line Width</td><td>Width of a single top/bottom line.</td></tr><tr><td>{infill_line_width}</td><td>Infill Line Width</td><td>Width of a single infill line.</td></tr><tr><td>{skirt_brim_line_width}</td><td>Skirt/Brim Line Width</td><td>Width of a single skirt or brim line.</td></tr><tr><td>{support_line_width}</td><td>Support Line Width</td><td>Width of a single support structure line.</td></tr><tr><td>{support_interface_line_width}</td><td>Support Interface Line Width</td><td>Width of a single line of support roof or floor.</td></tr><tr><td>{support_roof_line_width}</td><td>Support Roof Line Width</td><td>Width of a single support roof line.</td></tr><tr><td>{support_bottom_line_width}</td><td>Support Floor Line Width</td><td>Width of a single support floor line.</td></tr><tr><td>{prime_tower_line_width}</td><td>Prime Tower Line Width</td><td>Width of a single prime tower line.</td></tr><tr><td>{initial_layer_line_width_factor}</td><td>Initial Layer Line Width</td><td>Multiplier of the line width on the first layer. Increasing this could improve bed adhesion.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="3">Walls</th></tr><tr><td>{wall_extruder_nr}</td><td>Wall Extruder</td><td>The extruder train used for printing the walls. This is used in multi-extrusion.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_0_extruder_nr}</td><td>Outer Wall Extruder</td><td>The extruder train used for printing the outer wall. This is used in multi-extrusion.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_x_extruder_nr}</td><td>Inner Wall Extruder</td><td>The extruder train used for printing the inner walls. This is used in multi-extrusion.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_thickness}</td><td>Wall Thickness</td><td>The thickness of the walls in the horizontal direction. This value divided by the wall line width defines the number of walls.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_line_count}</td><td>Wall Line Count</td><td>The number of walls. When calculated by the wall thickness, this value is rounded to a whole number.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_0_wipe_dist}</td><td>Outer Wall Wipe Distance</td><td>Distance of a travel move inserted after the outer wall, to hide the Z seam better.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_0_inset}</td><td>Outer Wall Inset</td><td>Inset applied to the path of the outer wall. If the outer wall is smaller than the nozzle, and printed after the inner walls, use this offset to get the hole in the nozzle to overlap with the inner walls instead of the outside of the model.</td></tr><tr><td>{optimize_wall_printing_order}</td><td>Optimize Wall Printing Order</td><td>Optimize the order in which walls are printed so as to reduce the number of retractions and the distance travelled. Most parts will benefit from this being enabled but some may actually take longer so please compare the print time estimates with and without optimization. First layer is not optimized when choosing brim as build plate adhesion type.</td></tr><tr><td>{outer_inset_first}</td><td>Outer Before Inner Walls</td><td>Prints walls in order of outside to inside when enabled. This can help improve dimensional accuracy in X and Y when using a high viscosity plastic like ABS; however it can decrease outer surface print quality, especially on overhangs.</td></tr><tr><td>{alternate_extra_perimeter}</td><td>Alternate Extra Wall</td><td>Prints an extra wall at every other layer. This way infill gets caught between these extra walls, resulting in stronger prints.</td></tr><tr><td>{travel_compensate_overlapping_walls_enabled}</td><td>Compensate Wall Overlaps</td><td>Compensate the flow for parts of a wall being printed where there is already a wall in place.</td></tr><tr><td>{travel_compensate_overlapping_walls_0_enabled}</td><td>Compensate Outer Wall Overlaps</td><td>Compensate the flow for parts of an outer wall being printed where there is already a wall in place.</td></tr><tr><td>{travel_compensate_overlapping_walls_x_enabled}</td><td>Compensate Inner Wall Overlaps</td><td>Compensate the flow for parts of an inner wall being printed where there is already a wall in place.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_min_flow}</td><td>Minimum Wall Flow</td><td>Minimum allowed percentage flow for a wall line. The wall overlap compensation reduces a wall's flow when it lies close to an existing wall. Walls whose flow is less than this value will be replaced with a travel move. When using this setting, you must enable the wall overlap compensation and print the outer wall before inner walls.</td></tr><tr><td>{wall_min_flow_retract}</td><td>Prefer Retract</td><td>If enabled, retraction is used rather than combing for travel moves that replace walls whose flow is below the minimum flow threshold.</td></tr><tr><td>{fill_perimeter_gaps}</td><td>Fill Gaps Between Walls</td><td>Fills the gaps between walls where no walls fit.</td></tr><tr><td>{filter_out_tiny_gaps}</td><td>Filter Out Tiny Gaps</td><td>Filter out tiny gaps to reduce blobs on outside of model.</td></tr><tr><td>{fill_outline_gaps}</td><td>Print Thin Walls</td><td>Print pieces of the model which are horizontally thinner than the nozzle size.</td></tr><tr><td>{xy_offset}</td><td>Horizontal Expansion</td><td>Amount of offset applied to all polygons in each layer. Positive values can compensate for too big holes; negative values can compensate for too small holes.</td></tr><tr><td>{xy_offset_layer_0}</td><td>Initial Layer Horizontal Expansion</td><td>Amount of offset applied to all polygons in the first layer. A negative value can compensate for squishing of the first layer known as "elephant's foot".</td></tr><tr><td>{hole_xy_offset}</td><td>Hole Horizontal Expansion</td><td>Amount of offset applied to all holes in each layer. Positive values increase the size of the holes, negative values reduce the size of the holes.</td></tr><tr><td>{z_seam_type}</td><td>Z Seam Alignment</td><td>Starting point of each path in a layer. When paths in consecutive layers start at the same point a vertical seam may show on the print. When aligning these near a user specified location, the seam is easiest to remove. When placed randomly the inaccuracies at the paths' start will be less noticeable. When taking the shortest path the print will be quicker.</td></tr><tr><td>{z_seam_position}</td><td>Z Seam Position</td><td>The position near where to start printing each part in a layer.</td></tr><tr><td>{z_seam_x}</td><td>Z Seam X</td><td>The X coordinate of the position near where to start printing each part in a layer.</td></tr><tr><td>{z_seam_y}</td><td>Z Seam Y</td><td>The Y coordinate of the position near where to start printing each part in a layer.</td></tr><tr><td>{z_seam_corner}</td><td>Seam Corner Preference</td><td>Control whether corners on the model outline influence the position of the seam. None means that corners have no influence on the seam position. Hide Seam makes the seam more likely to occur on an inside corner. Expose Seam makes the seam more likely to occur on an outside corner. Hide or Expose Seam makes the seam more likely to occur at an inside or outside corner. Smart Hiding allows both inside and outside corners, but chooses inside corners more frequently, if appropriate.</td></tr><tr><td>{z_seam_relative}</td><td>Z Seam Relative</td><td>When enabled, the z seam coordinates are relative to each part's centre. When disabled, the coordinates define an absolute position on the build plate.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="3">Top/Bottom</th></tr><tr><td>{roofing_extruder_nr}</td><td>Top Surface Skin Extruder</td><td>The extruder train used for printing the top most skin. This is used in multi-extrusion.</td></tr><tr><td>{roofing_layer_count}</td><td>Top Surface Skin Layers</td><td>The number of top most skin layers. Usually only one top most layer is sufficient to generate higher quality top surfaces.</td></tr><tr><td>{top_bottom_extruder_nr}</td><td>Top/Bottom Extruder</td><td>The extruder train used for printing the top and bottom skin. This is used in multi-extrusion.</td></tr><tr><td>{top_bottom_thickness}</td><td>Top/Bottom Thickness</td><td>The thickness of the top/bottom layers in the print. This value divided by the layer height defines the number of top/bottom layers.</td></tr><tr><td>{top_thickness}</td><td>Top Thickness</td><td>The thickness of the top layers in the print. This value divided by the layer height defines the number of top layers.</td></tr><tr><td>{top_layers}</td><td>Top Layers</td><td>The number of top layers. When calculated by the top thickness, this value is rounded to a whole number.</td></tr><tr><td>{bottom_thickness}</td><td>Bottom Thickness</td><td>The thickness of the bottom layers in the print. This value divided by the layer height defines the number of bottom layers.</td></tr><tr><td>{bottom_layers}</td><td>Bottom Layers</td><td>The number of bottom layers. When calculated by the bottom thickness, this value is rounded to a whole number.</td></tr><tr><td>{initial_bottom_layers}</td><td>Initial Bottom Layers</td><td>The number of initial bottom layers, from the build-plate upwards. When calculated by the bottom thickness, this value is rounded to a whole number.</td></tr><tr><td>{top_bottom_pattern}</td><td>Top/Bottom Pattern</td><td>The pattern of the top/bottom layers.</td></tr><tr><td>{top_bottom_pattern_0}</td><td>Bottom Pattern Initial Layer</td><td>The pattern on the bottom of the print on the first layer.</td></tr><tr><td>{connect_skin_polygons}</td><td>Connect Top/Bottom Polygons</td><td>Connect top/bottom skin paths where they run next to each other. For the concentric pattern enabling this setting greatly reduces the travel time, but because the connections can happen midway over infill this feature can reduce the top surface quality.</td></tr><tr><td>{skin_angles}</td><td>Top/Bottom Line Directions</td><td>A list of integer line directions to use when the top/bottom layers use the lines or zig zag pattern. Elements from the list are used sequentially as the layers progress and when the end of the list is reached, it starts at the beginning again. The list items are separated by commas and the whole list is contained in square brackets. Default is an empty list which means use the traditional default angles (45 and 135 degrees).</td></tr><tr><td>{skin_no_small_gaps_heuristic}</td><td>No Skin in Z Gaps</td><td>When the model has small vertical gaps of only a few layers, there should normally be skin around those layers in the narrow space. Enable this setting to not generate skin if the vertical gap is very small. This improves printing time and slicing time, but technically leaves infill exposed to the air.</td></tr><tr><td>{skin_outline_count}</td><td>Extra Skin Wall Count</td><td>Replaces the outermost part of the top/bottom pattern with a number of concentric lines. Using one or two lines improves roofs that start on infill material.</td></tr><tr><td>{ironing_enabled}</td><td>Enable Ironing</td><td>Go over the top surface one additional time, but this time extruding very little material. This is meant to melt the plastic on top further, creating a smoother surface. The pressure in the nozzle chamber is kept high so that the creases in the surface are filled with material.</td></tr><tr><td>{ironing_only_highest_layer}</td><td>Iron Only Highest Layer</td><td>Only perform ironing on the very last layer of the mesh. This saves time if the lower layers don't need a smooth surface finish.</td></tr><tr><td>{ironing_pattern}</td><td>Ironing Pattern</td><td>The pattern to use for ironing top surfaces.</td></tr><tr><td>{ironing_line_spacing}</td><td>Ironing Line Spacing</td><td>The distance between the lines of ironing.</td></tr><tr><td>{ironing_flow}</td><td>Ironing Flow</td><td>The amount of material, relative to a normal skin line, to extrude during ironing. Keeping the nozzle filled helps filling some of the crevices of the top surface, but too much results in overextrusion and blips on the side of the surface.</td></tr><tr><td>{ironing_inset}</td><td>Ironing Inset</td><td>A distance to keep from the edges of the model. Ironing all the way to the edge of the mesh may result in a jagged edge on your print.</td></tr><tr><td>{speed_ironing}</td><td>Ironing Speed</td><td>The speed at which to pass over the top surface.</td></tr><tr><td>{acceleration_ironing}</td><td>Ironing Acceleration</td><td>The acceleration with which ironing is performed.</td></tr><tr><td>{jerk_ironing}</td><td>Ironing Jerk</td><td>The maximum instantaneous velocity change while performing ironing.</td></tr><tr><td>{skin_overlap}</td><td>Skin Overlap Percentage</td><td>Adjust the amount of overlap between the walls and (the endpoints of) the skin-centerlines, as a percentage of the line widths of the skin lines and the innermost wall. A slight overlap allows the walls to connect firmly to the skin. Note that, given an equal skin and wall line-width, any percentage over 50% may already cause any skin to go past the wall, because at that point the position of the nozzle of the skin-extruder may already reach past the middle of the wall.</td></tr><tr><td>{skin_overlap_mm}</td><td>Skin Overlap</td><td>Adjust the amount of overlap between the walls and (the endpoints of) the skin-centerlines. A slight overlap allows the walls to connect firmly to the skin. Note that, given an equal skin and wall line-width, any value over half the width of the wall may already cause any skin to go past the wall, because at that point the position of the nozzle of the skin-extruder may already reach past the middle of the wall.</td></tr><tr><td>{skin_preshrink}</td><td>Skin Removal Width</td><td>The largest width of skin areas which are to be removed. Every skin area smaller than this value will disappear. This can help in limiting the amount of time and material spent on printing top/bottom skin at slanted surfaces in the model.</td></tr><tr><td>{top_skin_preshrink}</td><td>Top Skin Removal Width</td><td>The largest width of top skin areas which are to be removed. Every skin area smaller than this value will disappear. This can help in limiting the amount of time and material spent on printing top skin at slanted surfaces in the model.</td></tr><tr><td>{bottom_skin_preshrink}</td><td>Bottom Skin Removal Width</td><td>The largest width of bottom skin areas which are to be removed. Every skin area smaller than this value will disappear. This can help in limiting the amount of time and material spent on printing bottom skin at slanted surfaces in the model.</td></tr><tr><td>{expand_skins_expand_distance}</td><td>Skin Expand Distance</td><td>The distance the skins are expanded into the infill. Higher values makes the skin attach better to the infill pattern and makes the walls on neighboring layers adhere better to the skin. Lower values save amount of material used.</td></tr><tr><td>{top_skin_expand_distance}</td><td>Top Skin Expand Distance</td><td>The distance the top skins are expanded into the infill. Higher values makes the skin attach better to the infill pattern and makes the walls on the layer above adhere better to the skin. Lower values save amount of material used.</td></tr><tr><td>{bottom_skin_expand_distance}</td><td>Bottom Skin Expand Distance</td><td>The distance the bottom skins are expanded into the infill. Higher values makes the skin attach better to the infill pattern and makes the skin adhere better to the walls on the layer below. Lower values save amount of material used.</td></tr><tr><td>{max_skin_angle_for_expansion}</td><td>Maximum Skin Angle for Expansion</td><td>Top and/or bottom surfaces of your object with an angle larger than this setting, won't have their top/bottom skin expanded. This avoids expanding the narrow skin areas that are created when the model surface has a near vertical slope. An angle of 0° is horizontal and will cause no skin to be expanded, while an angle of 90° is vertical and will cause all skin to be expanded.</td></tr><tr><td>{min_skin_width_for_expansion}</td><td>Minimum Skin Width for Expansion</td><td>Skin areas narrower than this are not expanded. This avoids expanding the narrow skin areas that are created when the model surface has a slope close to the vertical.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="3">Infill</th></tr><tr><td>{infill_extruder_nr}</td><td>Infill Extruder</td><td>The extruder train used for printing infill. This is used in multi-extrusion.</td></tr><tr><td>{infill_sparse_density}</td><td>Infill Density</td><td>Adjusts the density of infill of the print.</td></tr><tr><td>{infill_line_distance}</td><td>Infill Line Distance</td><td>Distance between the printed infill lines. This setting is calculated by the infill density and the infill line width.</td></tr><tr><td>{infill_pattern}</td><td>Infill Pattern</td><td>The pattern of the infill material of the print. The line and zig zag infill swap direction on alternate layers, reducing material cost. The grid, triangle, tri-hexagon, cubic, octet, quarter cubic, cross and concentric patterns are fully printed every layer. Gyroid, cubic, quarter cubic and octet infill change with every layer to provide a more equal distribution of strength over each direction.</td></tr><tr><td>{zig_zaggify_infill}</td><td>Connect Infill Lines</td><td>Connect the ends where the infill pattern meets the inner wall using a line which follows the shape of the inner wall. Enabling this setting can make the infill adhere to the walls better and reduce the effects of infill on the quality of vertical surfaces. Disabling this setting reduces the amount of material used.</td></tr><tr><td>{connect_infill_polygons}</td><td>Connect Infill Polygons</td><td>Connect infill paths where they run next to each other. For infill patterns which consist of several closed polygons, enabling this setting greatly reduces the travel time.</td></tr><tr><td>{infill_angles}</td><td>Infill Line Directions</td><td>A list of integer line directions to use. Elements from the list are used sequentially as the layers progress and when the end of the list is reached, it starts at the beginning again. The list items are separated by commas and the whole list is contained in square brackets. Default is an empty list which means use the traditional default angles (45 and 135 degrees for the lines and zig zag patterns and 45 degrees for all other patterns).</td></tr><tr><td>{infill_offset_x}</td><td>Infill X Offset</td><td>The infill pattern is moved this distance along the X axis.</td></tr><tr><td>{infill_offset_y}</td><td>Infill Y Offset</td><td>The infill pattern is moved this distance along the Y axis.</td></tr><tr><td>{infill_randomize_start_location}</td><td>Randomize Infill Start</td><td>Randomize which infill line is printed first. This prevents one segment becoming the strongest, but it does so at the cost of an additional travel move.</td></tr><tr><td>{infill_multiplier}</td><td>Infill Line Multiplier</td><td>Convert each infill line to this many lines. The extra lines do not cross over each other, but avoid each other.

However, it also ignores layer holes which can be viewed from above or below.</td></tr><tr><td>{meshfix_extensive_stitching}</td><td>Extensive Stitching</td><td>Extensive stitching tries to stitch up open holes in the mesh by closing the hole with touching polygons. This option can introduce a lot of processing time.</td></tr><tr><td>{meshfix_keep_open_polygons}</td><td>Keep Disconnected Faces</td><td>Normally Cura tries to stitch up small holes in the mesh and remove parts of a layer with big holes.

If you increase this, the travel moves will have less smooth corners. This may allow the printer to keep up with the speed it has to process g-code, but it may cause model avoidance to become less accurate.</td></tr><tr><td>{meshfix_maximum_deviation}</td><td>Maximum Deviation</td><td>The maximum deviation allowed when reducing the resolution for the Maximum Resolution setting.

This feature should only be enabled when each layer only contains a single part.</td></tr><tr><td>{smooth_spiralized_contours}</td><td>Smooth Spiralized Contours</td><td>Smooth the spiralized contours to reduce the visibility of the Z seam (the Z seam should be barely visible on the print but will still be visible in the layer view). Note that smoothing will tend to blur fine surface details.</td></tr><tr><td>{relative_extrusion}</td><td>Relative Extrusion</td><td>Use relative extrusion rather than absolute extrusion. Using relative E-steps makes for easier post-processing of the g-code. However, it's not supported by all printers and it may produce very slight deviations in the amount of deposited material compared to absolute E-steps. Irrespective of this setting, the extrusion mode will always be set to absolute before any g-code script is output.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="3">Experimental</th></tr><tr><td>{slicing_tolerance}</td><td>Slicing Tolerance</td><td>Vertical tolerance in the sliced layers.

This distance is compensated for. Only applies to Wire Printing.</td></tr><tr><td>{wireframe_strategy}</td><td>WP Strategy</td><td>Strategy for making sure two consecutive layers connect at each connection point. Retraction lets the upward lines harden in the right position, but may cause filament grinding.
